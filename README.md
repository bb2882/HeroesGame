# Project "Heroes"

Hello! This is the repository for the "Project Name" project, built with React and Redux. The project is an interactive form for creating and managing characters with different elemental abilities (fire, water, earth, air).

![Heroes](https://github.com/bb2882/React-Redux_Game/assets/70382872/5397e816-91b1-4a7c-b005-e6463770b495)

## Key Features

1. **Character Creation:** Users can fill out information about a character, such as name, abilities, and the element the character controls.

2. **Adding Characters:** After filling out the form, users can click the "Create" button to add the character to the page and save it in a local JSON file.

3. **Filtering by Elements:** The page includes a filter that allows users to display only characters associated with a specific element (fire, water, earth, air).

4. **Character Deletion:** Each created character has a cross icon that allows users to delete the character both from the display and the local JSON file.
